**Q: What is the difference between using the local instance store and Amazon Elastic Block Store \(Amazon EBS\) for the root device?**

When you launch your Amazon EC2 instances you have the ability to store your root device data on Amazon EBS or the local instance store. By using Amazon EBS, data on the root device will persist independently from the lifetime of the instance. This enables you to stop and restart the instance at a subsequent time, which is similar to shutting down your laptop and restarting it when you need it again.

Alternatively, the local instance store only persists during the life of the instance. This is an inexpensive way to launch instances where data is not stored to the root device. For example, some customers use this option to run large web sites where each instance is a clone to handle web traffic.

**Q: How do I load and store my systems with Amazon EC2?**

Amazon EC2 allows you to set up and configure everything about your instances from your operating system up to your applications. An Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) is simply a packaged-up environment that includes all the necessary bits to set up and boot your instance. Your AMIs are your unit of deployment. You might have just one AMI or you might compose your system out of several building block AMIs \(e.g., webservers, appservers, and databases\). Amazon EC2 provides a number of tools to make creating an AMI easy. Once you create a custom AMI, you will need to bundle it. If you are bundling an image with a root device backed by Amazon EBS, you can simply use the bundle command in the AWS Management Console. If you are bundling an image with a boot partition on the instance store, then you will need to use the AMI Tools to upload it to Amazon S3. Amazon EC2 uses Amazon EBS and Amazon S3 to provide reliable, scalable storage of your AMIs so that we can boot them when you ask us to do so.

Or, if you want, you donâ€™t have to set up your own AMI from scratch. You can choose from a number of globally available AMIs that provide useful instances. For example, if you just want a simple Linux server, you can choose one of the standard Linux distribution AMIs.



**Q: How do I select the right instance type?**

Amazon EC2 instances are grouped into 5 families: General Purpose, Compute Optimized, Memory Optimized, Storage Optimized and Accelerated Computing instances. General Purpose Instances have memory to CPU ratios suitable for most general purpose applications and come with fixed performance \(M5, M4\) or burstable performance \(T2\); Compute Optimized instances \(C5, C4\) have proportionally more CPU resources than memory \(RAM\) and are well suited for scale out compute-intensive applications and High Performance Computing \(HPC\) workloads; Memory Optimized Instances \(X1e, X1, R4\) offer larger memory sizes for memory-intensive applications, including database and memory caching applications; Accelerating Computing instances \(P3, P2, G3, F1\) take advantage of the parallel processing capabilities of NVIDIA Tesla GPUs for high performance computing and machine/deep learning; GPU Graphics instances \(G3\) offer high-performance 3D graphics capabilities for applications using OpenGL and DirectX; F1 instances deliver Xilinx FPGA-based reconfigurable computing; Storage Optimized Instances \(H1, I3, D2\) that provide very high, low latency, I/O capacity using SSD-based local instance storage for I/O-intensive applications, with D2 or H1, the dense-storage and HDD-storage instances, provide local high storage density and sequential I/O performance for data warehousing, Hadoop and other data-intensive applications. When choosing instance types, you should consider the characteristics of your application with regards to resource utilization \(i.e. CPU, Memory, Storage\) and select the optimal instance family and instance size.
