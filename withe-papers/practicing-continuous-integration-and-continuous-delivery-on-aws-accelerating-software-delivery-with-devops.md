## What is Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment?

---

### Continuous Integration

> _Continuous integration \(CI\) is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run_

### Continuous Delivery and Deployment

> _Continuous delivery \(CD\) is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for production release_

### Continuous Delivery Is Not Continuous Deployment

> _One misconception about continuous delivery is that it means every change committed is applied to production immediately after passing automated tests_

## Benefits of Continuous Delivery

---

> _automating the process, improving developer productivity, improving code quality, and delivering updates to your customers faster_
