# Optimizing Enterprise Economics with Serverless Architectures

## Understanding Serverless Applications

---

* There is no need to provision, deploy, update, monitor, or otherwise manage servers. All of the actual hardware and server software is handled by the cloud provider.
* The application scales automatically, triggered by its actual use. This is inherently different from conventional applications, which require a receiver fleet and explicit capacity management to scale to peak load.
* In addition to scaling, availability and fault tolerance are built in. No coding, configuration, or management is required to gain the benefit of these capabilities.
* There are no charges for idle capacity. There is no need \(and in fact, no ability\) to pre-provision or over-provision capacity. Instead, billing is pay-per-request and based on the duration it takes for code to run.

### Serverless Application Use Cases

### Is Serverless Always Appropriate?

below is not appropriate:

* When the goal is explicitly to avoid making any changes to an application.
* When fine-grained control over the environment is required, such as specifying particular operating system patches or accessing low-level networking operations, in order for the code to run properly.
* When an on-premises application hasn’t been migrated to the public cloud.
