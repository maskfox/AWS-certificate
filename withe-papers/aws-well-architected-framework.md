# AWS Well-Architected Framework

## Introduction

---

The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of decisions you make while building systems on AWS

### Definitions![](/assets/fiverpillars.png)

### On Architecture

### General Design Principles

Stop guessing your capacity needs

Test systems at production scale

Automate to make architectural experimentation easier

Allow for evolutionary architectures

Drive architectures using data

Improve through game days

## The Five Pillars of the Well-Architected Framework

---

### Operational Excellence

#### Design Principles

Perform operations as code

Annotate documentation

Make frequent, small, reversible changes

Refine operations procedures frequently

Anticipate failure:

Learn from all operational failures

#### Best Practices

**Prepare:** AWS Config and AWS Config rules can be used to create standards for

workloads and to determine if environments are compliant with those standards

before being put into production.

**Operate ** Amazon CloudWatch allows you to monitor the operational health of a

workload.

**Evolve  **Amazon Elasticsearch Service \(Amazon ES\) allows you to analyze your log

data to gain actionable insights quickly and securely.
