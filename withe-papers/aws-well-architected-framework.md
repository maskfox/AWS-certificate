# AWS Well-Architected Framework

## Introduction

---

The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of decisions you make while building systems on AWS

### Definitions![](/assets/fiverpillars.png)

### On Architecture

### General Design Principles

Stop guessing your capacity needs

Test systems at production scale

Automate to make architectural experimentation easier

Allow for evolutionary architectures

Drive architectures using data

Improve through game days

## The Five Pillars of the Well-Architected Framework

---

### Operational Excellence

#### Design Principles

Perform operations as code

Annotate documentation

Make frequent, small, reversible changes

Refine operations procedures frequently

Anticipate failure:

Learn from all operational failures

#### Best Practices

**Prepare:** AWS Config and AWS Config rules can be used to create standards for

workloads and to determine if environments are compliant with those standards

before being put into production.

**Operate ** Amazon CloudWatch allows you to monitor the operational health of a

workload.

**Evolve  **Amazon Elasticsearch Service \(Amazon ES\) allows you to analyze your log

data to gain actionable insights quickly and securely.

### Security

#### Design Principles

Implement a strong identity foundation

Enable traceability

Apply security at all layers:

Automate security best practices

Protect data in transit and at rest

Keep people away from data

Prepare for security events

#### Best Practices

1. Identity and Access Management

2. Detective Controls

3. Infrastructure Protection

4. Data Protection

5. Incident Response

### Reliability

#### Design Principles

Test recovery procedures

Automatically recover from failure:

Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability

Stop guessing capacity

Manage change in automation

#### Best Practices

1. Foundations

2. Change Management

3. Failure Management

---

### Performance Efficiency

#### Design Principles

Democratize advanced technologies

Go global in minutes

Use serverless architectures

Experiment more often:

Mechanical sympathy

#### Best Practices

1. Selection

2. Review

3. Monitoring

4. Tradeoffs
