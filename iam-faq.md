**Q: How do I get started with IAM?**

To start using IAM, you must subscribe to at least one of the AWS services that is integrated with IAM. You then can create and manage users, groups, and permissions via IAM APIs, the AWS CLI, or the IAM console, which gives you a point-and-click, web-based interface. You can also use the visual editor to create policies.



**Q: How are IAM users managed?**  
IAM supports multiple methods to:

* Create and manage IAM users.
* Create and manage IAM groups.
* Manage users' security credentials.
* Create and manage policies to grant access to AWS services and resources.

You can create and manage users, groups, and policies by using IAM APIs, the [AWS CLI](http://aws.amazon.com/cli/), or the[IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home). You also can use the[visual editor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/iam/create-policies)and the [IAM policy simulator](https://policysim.aws.amazon.com/)to create and test policies.
