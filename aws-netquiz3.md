**Question 1**

You have multiple Amazon EC2 instances running in a cluster across multiple Availability Zones within the same region. What combination of the following should be used to ensure the highest network performance \(packets per second\), lowest latency, and lowest jitter? Choose 3 answers

1. Amazon EC2 placement groups \(would not work for multiple AZs\)
2. **Enhanced networking**
   \(provides network performance, lowest latency\)
3. Amazon PV AMI \(Requires HVM\)
4. **Amazon HVM AMI \(**Requires HVM**\)**
5. Amazon Linux \(Can be on others as well\)
6. **Amazon VPC**
   \(works only in VPC, canâ€™t enable enhanced networking if the instance is in EC2-Classic\)
